# Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction-using-Sentiment-Analysis

The objective is to find statistical correlation between social media sentiment and stock price movement of companies.

First, I predict the stock prices using the following 6 features - Open Stock price, Close Stock price, Low price, High price, Volume and Adj Close Price. Next, I performed sentiment analysis on tweets for that company posted on Twitter and used the social media sentiment score as an additional feature to predict the stock prices.

The difference in accuracy in both the models shall help us understand the correlation between social media sentiment and stock prices of companies. If the model with additional sentiment features performs better than the baseline model, then there exists a positive co-relation between social media sentiment and stock prices of a company, otherwise no such co-relation exists.
